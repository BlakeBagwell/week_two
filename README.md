The purpose of this project was to use objects, methods, and dictionaries to create a game where the user could generate random creatures. The creatures essentially were user created objects that had their attributes assigned by using a method that pulls values, such as scales or fur, from a dictionary I made.

General Success:
  The base of the project was completed, which was to have the user input a name of their choosing and then randomly generating a creature, afterwards it would print out a paragraph to the user detailing the creatures qualities.

  There is also an autosave and auto load feature that I added so all changes would persist from session to session.

Implementation Problems:
  Problems arose when I tried to implement a management system where the user could go back and review past creatures. A list of existing creatures could be generated and creatures could also be removed from the system, the major problem that occurred was calling the creatures' method (the one that is used upon initial creation to show the user what qualities the creature has) and having it print out the same information.

Features to Add:
  When I revisit this project I would like to add a few more things (in addition to fixing what needs to be fixed). The main feature I'd like to add is a 'breeding' method.

  The idea of the game is that creatures' qualities are randomized and therefore the user can't do very much with the game other than appreciating the randomness. The breeding feature would allow the user to select two previous creatures and have them mate, creating a new creature.

  The values of the attributes of the creatures would be stored in a new, temporary dictionary, and then a creature would be randomly generated using this new dictionary. This effectively would allow the user to slowly create a creature to their exactly liking through multiple breedings.

Conclusion:
  While I learned a lot from this project, I have to tell myself that part of the problem is my newness to Objects, methods, and dictionaries. I really enjoyed my concept and at a later time I would like to see it though. When I have a better grasp on how to build a better and more complete game, I'll fix the necessary problems and add the features that I've mentioned.
